# Cutting Machines Catalogue Application

## How to install the application

### 1. Download and install MySQL and Java if you do not have them
  To run the app you need to have MySQL Server (8.0 preferarably). You can download that from the [MySQL Community Downloads](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/) page and install it following the instructions given on the website. Of course you must have Java installed on your computer. The project is compiled on Java 11, so I would suggest going for that or a higher version. You can look for the newest Java releases on [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) or [the open JDK](https://openjdk.java.net/install/).
  
  PS: The default connection from the Java application to the database is with a username 'root' and password '123456'. If you wish to change those or you already have a connection with different parameters, open the CatalogueService. java with a text editor (e.g Notepad++) and change the "root" and "123456" on line 24 to whatever your username and password are.
